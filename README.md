Review the instructions below to access Cityhallin Valheim Dedicated Servers:

1. Open Steam, click on your Valheim game, and see if it needs updates. If it needs updates, it will have a blue **Update** button. 
<br />
If it is already up to date, it will have a green **Play** button. Once you have the green **Play** button, click it to start Valheim.

## Troubleshooting <a name="issues"></a>
The tips below can help if you have any issues. 
<br />
<br />

### Game Frame Rate Slow
Sometimes the framerate seems to be slow. If you have a video card that supports Vulkan, try to enable Valheim to use it on launch. 
1. In your steam game library, right click on Valehim and go to properties.

### Wrong Password Message
The **Wrong Password** message appears when the server password entered is incorrect. Check with your server admin to make sure the password you received is correct. Also make sure you do not have CAPS lock enabled on your kyeboard.
